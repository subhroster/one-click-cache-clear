    <h1>Privacy Policy for One-Click Cache Cleaner</h1>
    <p>Last updated: 19-Oct-2024</p>

    <p>This privacy policy governs your use of the One-Click Cache Cleaner Chrome extension. The primary purpose of this extension is to allow users to clear their browser cache, cookies, and history with a single click. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting it.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>One-Click Cache Cleaner does not collect, store, or share any personal data or information. The extension operates locally within your browser, and no user data is transmitted to external servers or third parties.</p>

    <h2>Use of Permissions</h2>
    <p>To perform its core functionality, the extension requests the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Browsing Data:</strong> We need access to your browser's cache, cookies, and history to allow you to clear them on demand. The extension only interacts with your browsing data when you specifically request it (i.e., when you click the "Clear" buttons). This data is not stored or transmitted outside of your browser.</li>
        <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> The extension uses notifications to inform you when the data you selected (cache, cookies, or history) has been successfully cleared. Notifications are used solely for user feedback purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>One-Click Cache Cleaner does not use any third-party services, analytics, or advertising networks. All operations are performed locally on your device, and no data is shared with external entities.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>As One-Click Cache Cleaner does not collect any personal data, there is no data to retain or delete.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We take the security of your information seriously. Since no data is collected or stored, there are no specific security measures related to data handling within the extension.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. When we do, we will update the "last updated" date at the top of the policy. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy or the One-Click Cache Cleaner extension, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:subhroster2007@gmail.com">subhroster2007@gmail.com</a></p>
